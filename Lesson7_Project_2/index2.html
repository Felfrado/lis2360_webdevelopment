            <p>People honestly don't give children enough credit, if properly instructed in an engaging way they are fast learners.</p>
            
            <p>That's because the imagination they have for the world around them is <i><b>overwhelmingly</b></i> full of wonder and awe.</p>
            
            <p>In this day and age of digital wonder teaching methods are increasingly utilizing technology to make learning more efficient and fun for children.<br>So why not give students in elementary schools the <b>ability to have fun with their imagination</b> while learning and implement more coding into their<br>education?</p>

                <li>Learning to code at a young age gives a competitive advantage later on in life</li>
                <li>Programmers are in high demand</li>
                <li>Coding teaches kids useful problem-solving skills</li>
                <li>Helps strengthen and improve creativity at an early age</li>

            <h2><em>Ways to engage and stimulate interest in coding at a young age:</em></h2>
            <p>There are many activities that children take part in that can peek their interest into wanting to learn how to code</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What kid doesn't love video games?</li>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most kids are constantly picking up video games to play and enjoy with their friends, and in my personal experience <br>at that age just playing video games makes you want to be able to create your own game where you can dream up a world to play in.</li><br>
                    <li>There are even some video games these days that will teach kids basic coding skills, one example would be the popular game: "MineCraft"</li><br>
                </ul>
                <li>Legos: Don't just build your imagination, code it!</li><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>legos have been a staple in childhood around the world, but you can do more than just build with legos, you can use them to build robots<br>and upload code to give them a brain!</li><br>
                    <li>Lego Robot competitions are already established events around the world, these competitions teach kids adversity, creativity, and problem solving<br> in fun and engaging ways. These also provide oppertunities for parents to help their kid and bond with doing something they enjoy!</li><br>
                </ul>
                <li>Website building!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growing up with the internet you end up seeing tons of interesting websites to explore or play on, having access to all the unique<br> environments often drives a child's desire to want to create their own, that was the case for some of my friends and I growing up.</li>
