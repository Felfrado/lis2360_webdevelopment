        <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
        <p>People honestly don't give children enough credit, if properly instructed in an engaging way they are fast learners.</p>
        
        <p>That's because the imagination they have for the world around them is <i><b>overwhelmingly</b></i> full of wonder and awe.</p>
        
        <p>In this day and age of digital wonder teaching methods are increasingly utilizing technology to make learning more efficient and fun for children.<br>So why not give students in elementary schools the <b>ability to have fun with their imagination</b> while learning and implement more coding into their<br>education?</p>

        <h2>Ways to engage and stimulate interest in coding at a young age:</h2>
        <p>There are many activities that children take part in that can peek their interest into wanting to learn how to code</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What kid doesn't love video games?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Most kids are constantly picking up video games to play and enjoy with their friends, and in my personal experience <br>at that age just playing video games makes you want to be able to create your own game where you can dream up a world to play in.</li>
                <li>There are even some video games these days that will teach kids basic coding skills, one example would be the popular game: "MineCraft"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Legos: Don't just build your imagination, code it!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>legos have been a staple in childhood around the world, but you can do more than just build with legos, you can use them to build robots<br>and upload code to give them a brain!</li>
                <li>Lego Robot competitions are already established events around the world, these competitions teach kids adversity, creativity, and problem solving<br> in fun and engaging ways. These also provide oppertunities for parents to help their kid and bond with doing something they enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Website building!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Growing up with the internet you end up seeing tons of interesting websites to explore or play on, having access to all the unique<br> environments often drives a child's desire to want to create their own, that was the case for some of my friends and I growing up.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

                <td>Creating games to gain interest in coding at a young age is something actually very common! Demand for programmers is only going to keep increasing in the digital age so it's worthwhile for many people to invest in the future and to teach their kids useful skills that will give them a competitive edge and set them up to prosper in the future!
